# Archived Notes

This folder contains historical protocol notes and reverse-engineering writeups
that are no longer authoritative. The current, consolidated specification lives
in `PROTOCOL.md` at the repository root.

Use these files only for historical context or raw capture references; details
may be incomplete or conflict with current findings.
